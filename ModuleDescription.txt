This module uses isoelectric focusing to deplete proteins within a certain isoelectric point range. 
In the application, the user is asked to set following parameters: The total number of potential fractions, the targeted fraction and whether to keep proteins within or outside of that very fraction. 
Based on that, the module is programmed to automatically set the pI range of the chosen arrangement. It will further compute whether proteins are depleted or not, i.e., if their isoelectric points are within the set pI range or not.
